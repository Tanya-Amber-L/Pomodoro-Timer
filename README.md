# ⏱️ Pomodoro-Timer

> Pomodoro Timer with React, using Hooks

## About

Small Pomodoro Timer (25 min work session followed by 5 min break), using React (hooks), Parcel & >>> . Done in 10/2021.

#### Resources

I followed [Leny‘s tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWrcHS-NChs) on Youtube, for the work methodology.
Differences:

-   In the meantime, Parcel upgraded to v2, so I used the newer version.
-   I used Bulma following the tutorial, but in the end I wanted to explore the Styles Components, so my styling is done with this.

#### Idea

The project is given to our [BeCode](https://becode.org/) juniors during their Web Developer training.

## Installation

-   `npm install`
-   `npm run build`
-   (Locally : `npm run work`)
